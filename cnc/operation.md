## Work Flow
- Autodesk Fusion 360 is used for the computer aided manufacturing (CAM) operations
- The CAM work consists of the following stages:
	- Create Setup - defines the stock/material that the model will be created from
	- Generate Tool Paths - dictates how/where a specific bit/mill moves, multiple tool paths are routinely used to manufacture parts.
	- Simulation - provides a virtual "mock up" of the tool paths without running the CNC
	- Post Processing - converts tool paths to CNC specific gcode
	- Run - gcode is executing on the physical CNC
