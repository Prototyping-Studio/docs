## File Formats
- Preferred file formats include: F3D, F3Z, STEP, SVG, DXF, PRT 
	- Always verify model dimensions, imported vector files files are not always the correct scale
	- "Inspect" tool is useful for verifying a known dimension
- Can accept OBJ and STL files if necessary
- Do NOT accept generated gcode (.PRG, .NC) files, tool paths must be validated before cutting
