- Choose collet corresponding to bit shank diameter
	- Collet size engraved on front face
	- 1/8", 1/4", 3/8", 1/2" imperial sizes available
	- 4mm, 6mm, 8mm metric sizes available
- Tighten bit in collet by hand (clockwise)
	- All cutting flutes should be below collet
	- The bit shank should be inserted a minimum of 2/3 (100% ideal) of the collet length
		- For example, a 1.5" length collet requires at least 1" of bit shank inserted, however ideal insert length is 1.5"
- Finish tightening bit in collet using "ER 32" wrench & CNC tool mount bracket
